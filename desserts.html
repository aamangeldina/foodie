                <p>I like the ginger to be quite assertive in my gingersnaps. but if you like the gingersnap flavor but don't like a subtle ginger-y burn, i would reduce the amount of ground ginger to 3/4 teaspoon-1 teaspoon.  then again, if you don't like gingersnaps at all, take out the spices and there you have yourself a batch of double chocolate chip cookies :)</p>

                <p>We woke up to our first snowfall the other morning, albeit a dusting; our plump christmas tree is up, decorated with ornaments we've collected throughout the years; lit with strands of twinkling lights, its base hidden under a burlap tree skirt i made years ago (a craft projects gone right!).  our winter vista is now official, as the trees across the way have lost the last of their leaves,  and we can squeak out a view of the top quarter of the empire state building once more.  the holidays are officially here, and even though it's felt like a merry season for the past few weeks, it's now in close sight.    </p>

                <p> Our thanksgiving was quiet in all the right places. of course we missed our family that we weren't able to see, but me, frank, and my in-laws sat around this lovely table and shared a number of yummy meals and tons of conversation  </p>

                  <a href="dessert1.html"> <img src="dessert6.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a>
                <p>These bars are the simplest and most rewarding snacks that come together and can be enjoyed in about 30 minutes (freezing the bars makes the set faster, which i'm a huge fan of!).  there's no baking, or setting, and they're kind of on the healthy side.  i used puffed varieties of brown rice and millet, which happen to be gluten free whole grains, plus, they have a super crunchy texture which gives them a rice crispy treat quality.  </p>
