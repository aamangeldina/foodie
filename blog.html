                    <h5> AUGUST 29, 2019</h5>
                    <p>We welcomed our little baby joey on august 15th.  we couldnâ€™t be more in love and smitten with him.  even amesy is tolerating his cries, and endless diaper changes.  heâ€™s even been pretty good at sharing me with his baby brother.  i plan to share a bit more about joeyâ€™s birth story.  but needless to say, itâ€™s been a wonderful, chaotic whirlwind.  so, stay tuned!   

                        <p>Letâ€™s talk pizza.  specifically this peach-y garlicky pizza that weâ€™ve been making all summer long!  this combination of ingredients was somewhat of a hodgepodge of things leftover in our fridge one saturday night/a medley of ingredients we frequently combine for salads and such.  the first thing you need is a ripe juicy peach.  iâ€™ve tried this with a semi-ripe, not-too-sweet peach, and while tasty, it didnâ€™t hit the right note (the sweet, juiciness is key here).  but since itâ€™s the height of peach season just about everywhere in the states, i doubt youâ€™ll have trouble finding one.  next, you need some really good aged balsamic.  the watery grocery store variety probably wonâ€™t cut it in terms of the sweet, acidic drizzle weâ€™re going for here. and lastly, a good pesto.  if iâ€™m not making my own, then a store bought version is just as good.  for cheese, i go between a buffalo milk fresh mozzarella, or a vegan mozzarella that are both wonderful here (of course depending on your diet).  and for the pizza crust, i always use my recipe for the best gluten free pizza dough, or, if iâ€™ve run out, i use this frozen dough that is quite good as a backup.</p>

                        <p>this is our go-to friday night summer pizza pie and i only thought it my duty to share its deliciousness here with you before we say goodbye to summer vacation.   i hope you get the chance to make it!  happy end of august!</p>

                      <h5>AUGUST 10, 2019 </h5>
                  <p>The ease of summer cooking (or lack thereof) is one of the most refreshing characteristics of the season.  (especially right now as iâ€™m hitting 40 weeks pregnant in the next few days ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜¬).  take this salad and toast.  not one thing is cooked (unless you consider toasting bread cooking).  rather, we take the peak of summer produce, chop it all up, top it over crusty bread, and a big splotch of the creamiest, yogurt-tahini.  itâ€™s quite literally the simplest of dishes/snacks/appetizers, but by far one of the most satisfying.  i love the combination of anything with yogurt-tahini, but when paired with vegetables it just takes everything up a notch.  
                      <p> I generally make a this recipe as my summer  veg + yogurt-tahini go-to, and then thereâ€™s this veg + yogurt-tahini winter go-to that i shared a few months ago.  the crispy veg, toasty bread, and creamy medley here is perfect for hot summer nights, a little date night situation with your loved one, a perfect nibble with your girlfriends accompanied by your favorite chilled cocktail.  whatever the occasion, these little toasts are sure to brighten them up quite a bit.  i hope you get to make this before the summer is up, itâ€™s a good one that hits all the right spots!

                      <p>When i think of peaches, i think of my husband; of summer, heat, of dirt roads, and farm stands. frank and i got married (almost 3 years ago!) on a fruit farm that was situated between a bay and a large inlet of water.  we stayed on the property the week before our nuptials to prepare for the wedding, and each morning we would take a morning run through the peach orchard, past the bay in the gleaming sunshine.  it was late july and it was glorious. </p>

                      <p>I'm sure we've all had (or have) that one recipe in our back pocket that makes us feel really accomplished or fancy, but the thought of veering away from what's comfortable into an unknown realm is packed with worry (maybe cooking is a metaphor for life?!).  so when i read julia turshen's intro in her new, and totally beautiful cookbook, small victories, i knew i was at home.  </p>

                        <a href="salad1.html">   <img src="salad3.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a>
                      <p>I've not only come to tolerate a kale salad, but absolutely love and crave it on most days!  i've found that a sufficient amount of massaging action, and a good period of rest really lets the kale chill out, relax a bit, and become more tender.  i also learned that a really tasty and substantial dressing goes a long way. i tend to go with a creamy base, either tahini or dairy-free yogurt, just to give it another texture. </p>

                        <a href="salad1.html"> <img src="salad7.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a>
                      <p>Besides using it for dipping, i love adding it to grain bowls or salads as a creamy alternative to a tahini or yogurt-based sauce.   in this recipe it's the dressing for a super simple chickpea and avocado salad that adds a mellow coolness from the dill and cucumber.  this is a perfect picnic salad (it's totally vegan, so you don't have to worry about it going bad on a warm day), a simple lunch, or as a companion to a dinner meal.</p>
